                        <p>You will probably not be able to live at Tingbjerg  without visiting our bar at least once. Located just below building 10, and run by our residents (the Bar Committee), it is a great place to  blow off some steam after a long week. Open most Thursdays from  21-23, and on some Saturdays for bigger parties. But let the pictures speak instead of  the words. <br> To get regular updates about parties and other events (like the famous Tour De Kitchen), join the bar's Facebook page!</p>
